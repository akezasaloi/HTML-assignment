    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> During my first weeek at AkiraChix campus, I had so much fun learning various cultures 
        from all around the eastern part of Africa. <br>In addition to socialising with fellow collegues from different countries, we had some not so fun 
        activities planned for us as well as some challenging rules to follow such as: </p>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;">
            <li>Daily cleaning of our rooms, classes and the common area </li>
            <li>Weekly general cleaning of our rooms and the common area</li>
            <li>Leaving phones in our rooms for all class hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> Regardless of all that though, AkiraChix had a lot of enjoyable things to offer for example:</p>
    <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;">
        <li>A tour of the campus by the alumni</li>
        <li>Four daily delicious and nutritious meals</li>
        <li>Hot showers in the mornings!</li>
        <li>A great First Aid & Safety Awareness training session</li>
        <li>Role play educative and funny presentation </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> In sum, all AkiraChix staff and alumni have been nothing but welcoming and kind, 
    Infact they even provided me a room to pray and accomodated me while I was fasting!<br> It might have been hard to adjust to the quick schedule 
    but all things considered I had a great experience.</p>
